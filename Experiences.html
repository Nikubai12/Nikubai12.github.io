            As a member of the mission design team, I aid in performing and analyzing satellite simulations using STK
             to determine various aspects of the Satellite's behaviour in orbit. <br><br>
             I am also responsible for defining the various operational modes of the satellite and what tasks it will be performing 
             in these modes and wether the battery voltages will permit thes activities or no.
             <br><br> I am also learning how to operate the satellite remotely from our ground station here at the University of Alberta.

           <p style="font-size: 2vw; text-align: center";> <br> <br>
            As a senior cadet at my squadron, I take on many leadership roles and taskings and have gained valuable experiences from these roles both at
            home and from 9 weeks of training in Vernon, BC.
            I then used these skills to advance my home squadron and attain many new opportuinities, such as being selected for pilot training or
            being able to lead my squadron through many activities. The entire time I either worked directly with cadets, or trained a team of seniors 
            and oversaw the operation. <br><br>
            I was truly honored when I was able to meet Lt. General Al Meinzinger, commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force, and exchange viewpoints
            on various methods of leadership and how we employ them.
